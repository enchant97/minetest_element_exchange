## Stopping Development
I am no longer working on this project.

Another user has taken up development of this project and whilst I am not affiliated with this project (nor tested) but seems like a good continuation: <https://github.com/thepython10110/exchangeclone>.

## Features
- Orb that holds energy
- Collector that collects energy from the sun
- Constructor that can convert one node into different node
- Deconstructor that can extract energy from a node

## Config
You can change the default values in the minetest settings under `mods > element_exchange`.
